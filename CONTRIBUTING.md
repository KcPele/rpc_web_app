## üßë‚Äçüíª Code Style & Guidelines

- **Language:** TypeScript (strict mode enabled)
- **Framework:** Next.js 13+
- **Styling:** Tailwind CSS (utility-first, use config variables)
- **UI:** Use and extend components in `components/ui/` and `components/layout/`.
- **Linting:** Run `npm run lint` before pushing. Fix all errors and warnings.
- **Accessibility:** Use semantic HTML and accessible components (Radix UI, ARIA attributes).
- **Testing:** (If adding/altering logic, add or update tests. Preferred: Jest, React Testing Library)
- **Documentation:** Add comments for complex logic. Update README or relevant docs if needed.
